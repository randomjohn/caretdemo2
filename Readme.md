Upstate Analytics Meetup Group discussion on the caret package
==============================================================

This repository contains all the files used at the Upstate Analytics Meetup Group on March ?, 2015. The purpose of the discussion was to introduce the caret package, a package designed for machine learning using the [R](http://www.r-project.org) package.

## Data

The data used in the discussion is from the [Human Activity Recognition lab](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#collaborators#ixzz3IgG0oJx1).

## Preparation

If you wish to follow along, you will need the following:

 * R version 3.2.3 (or any recent version; I do not recommend earlier than 3.1.3 though)
 * R studio (optional except for the markdown file handling, but highly recommended)
 * the _caret_ and _doParallel_ packages
 * the _e1071_ package
 * a clone your own version of this github repository (or simply download a zip of it if you don't use GitHub)
 
Be warned: because caret provides an interface to all sorts of machine learning packages, its dependency list is extensive. You probably won't have time to install during the talk. If you are following along, please have everything set up before the talk.

## Caret documentation

Please see documentation at the [caret website](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html).
