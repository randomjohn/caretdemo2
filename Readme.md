Upstate Analytics Meetup Group discussion on the caret package
==============================================================

This repository contains all the files used at the Upstate Analytics Meetup Group on March ?, 2015. The purpose of the discussion was to introduce the caret package, a package designed for machine learning using the [R](http://www.r-project.org) package.

## Data

The data used in the discussion is from the [Human Activity Recognition lab](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#collaborators#ixzz3IgG0oJx1).

## Preparation

If you wish to follow along, you will need to clone your own version of this github repository (or simply download a zip of it if you don't use GitHub). You will also need to install the _caret_ and _doParallel_ libraries. In places, _e1071_ is used as well. Be warned: because caret provides an interface to all sorts of machine learning packages, its dependency list is extensive. You probably won't have time to install during the talk.
